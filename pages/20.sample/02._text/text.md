As they explored, Kittyfish marveled at the peculiar Martian landscape. Strange, fluffy clouds floated by, looking just like cotton candy, and vibrant red flowers with polka-dotted petals waved hello in the gentle breeze. Suddenly, Kittyfish spotted something shimmering in the distance.

Long, floppy antennae wave around like playful seaweed, while wiggly fins flail and wade through the sky in an adorable dance.
