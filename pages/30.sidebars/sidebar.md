### Page content

* On mobile any sidebar positioned `left` will always appear **above** the page content. Think “FAQ“ to quickly link to specific parts of your site.

* On mobile any sidebar positioned `right` will always appear **below** the page content, but before any modules. Think “Further Reading“ to assemble your footnotes.

### Module support

* `links` will always appear in the Sidebar itself
* All other modules will appear below the page content
* Shown here is the `text` module with a button

... scroll down to the text module ...
